# Tennis_ML
Machine Learning project to predict number of games in a tennis match.
This is an academic project to test how five distinct machine learning methods perform in predicting the number of games in a tennis match.

LR, RF, MLP, SVM, XGBoost, Boosting ## Each Machine Learning technique with funtion for hyperparameters

Files .pkl ## Best model of each technique to be called later on Final Model Selection.

Final Model Selection ## Call all the .pkl files and run in validation dataset to check the metrics.
