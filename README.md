# Tennis_ML
Machine Learning project to predict number of games in a tennis match.

This is an academic project, my first ML project, to test how five distinct machine learning methods perform in predicting the number of games in a tennis match.

Files:

Exploring_data_Tennis ## Data Transformation, Exploration, and Cleaning 

LR, RF, MLP, SVM, XGBoost, Boosting ## Each Machine Learning technique with function for hyperparameters

Files .pkl ## Best model of each technique to be called later on Final Model Selection.

Final Model Selection ## Call all the .pkl files and run in the validation dataset to check the metrics.
